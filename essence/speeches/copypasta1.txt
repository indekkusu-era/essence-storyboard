The tiebreaker is undeniably the essence of all tournaments.|
It is the fruit of hard work,| the culmination of a valiant effort
to fight| and the manifestation of absolute determination.|
It is the desperation that creates friendship,|
the flood of adrenaline that replenishes life| and the myriad of emotions that 
make one feel ever so momentarily blissful,|
that they could relish in the very moment where everyone belongs 
in the game.|

I really love the tiebreaker
